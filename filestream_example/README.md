# filestream_example
This example demonstrates the use of the fstream library to create, open, read and write to files

fstream is a library that is part of the standard library and is derived from the iostream library, so you have to include iostream as well as fstream.

fstream has three classes:

ofstream - output stream, for writing to files
ifstream - input stream, for reading to files
fstream - file stream, for reading and writing to files
